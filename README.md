# Dream Team Builder ⚽

## Overview  
Dream Team Builder is a social media platform where users can create and share their ultimate football dream team. Users can select players from a preloaded **SQLite database** and showcase their custom lineup. The project aims to provide an engaging way for football fans to discuss and compare their dream teams.

## Features  
✅ **User-created posts** – Share your dream team with others.  
✅ **SQLite Database Integration** – Select players from an existing database.  
✅ **Modern Frontend** – Built with **HTML & CSS** for a clean, responsive UI.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS  
- **Backend:** (Intended) Python / Flask  
- **Database:** SQLite  

## Status 🚧  
Unfortunately, the project did not compile due to technical issues. However, the `index.html` page successfully presents our core idea and provides a glimpse into the intended functionality.

## How to Run 🏃  
1. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the basic UI.  
2. The backend is incomplete, so database functionality is currently unavailable.  

## Future Improvements 🚀  
- Fix backend issues to support full player selection.  
- Implement user authentication for personalized team building.  
- Improve the UI with JavaScript for a more interactive experience.
